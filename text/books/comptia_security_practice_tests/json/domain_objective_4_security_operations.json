Henry knows that if his staff change their password periodically that it can help avoid issues with reuse on other sites. He also knows that multifactor is a more effective solu-tion and that he should focus his time there as well. Password length and complexity don\u2019t matter if the password was compromised elsewhere, and minimum age policies are used to prevent reuse in the organization by resetting passwords over and over again to return to an original desired password. Note that policies like this don\u2019t stop reuse outside of a user\u2019s organization on 3rd party sites!",
